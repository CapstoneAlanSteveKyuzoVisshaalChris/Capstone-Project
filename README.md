Capstone Project
Our project is to build a web app that recommends movies to users. The web app will allow users to enter preferences and will give users a movie that they might like, using a combination of Discovery and Assistant. The program will also try to not simply recommend the most popular movies, but take a deeper dive in what the movie might be about, while avoiding movies the user has seen. The app will use different APIs and a database in order to store all the movie data in order to tailor it to each individual user. (We are planning to add other details and functionality later)
