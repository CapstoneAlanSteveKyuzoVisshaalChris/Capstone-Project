"docker-compose up" should usually start the server, but if that doesn't work,
"sudo docker-compose up" will start the server (no matter what).

To terminate the server press Ctrl+C.

If there are "code update doesn't seem to have done anything errors":
Don't forget: "docker-compose down"
And then: Delete "image" from Docker Desktop
